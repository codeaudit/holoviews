  Multi-dimensional containers for animating and faceting your data
  flexibly.

* `Building Composite Objects <Building_Composite_Objects.html>`_
  How to build and work with nested composite objects.

* `Live Data <Live_Data.html>`_
  Lazily generate data on the fly and generate engaging interactive
  visualizations.

* `Gridded Datasets <Gridded_Datasets.html>`_
  Explore gridded data (n-dimensional arrays) with NumPy and XArray.

* `Indexing and Selecting Data <Indexing_and_Selecting_Data.html>`_
  Select and index subsets of your data with HoloViews.

* `Transforming Elements <Transforming_Elements.html>`_
  Apply operations to your data that can be used to build data analysis pipelines

* `Responding to Events <Responding_to_Events.html>`_
  Allow your visualizations to respond to Python events using the
  HoloViews 'streams' system.

* `Custom Interactivity <Custom_Interactivity.html>`_
  Use Bokeh and 'linked streams' to directly interact with your visualizations.

* `Data Processing Pipelines <Data_Pipelines.html>`_
  Chain operations to build sophisticated, interactive and lazy data
  analysis pipelines.

  Styling options and unique Matplotlib features such as GIF/MP4 support.

* `Plotting with plotly <Plotting_with_Plotly.html>`_
  Styling options and unique plotly features, focusing on 3D plotting.

* `Working with renderers and plots <Plots_and_Renderers.html>`_
  Directly using the background ``Renderer`` and ``Plot`` classes for
  direct access to the plotting machinery.

* `Exporting and Archiving <Exporting_and_Archiving.html>`_
  Using HoloViews to archive both your data and visualization.
